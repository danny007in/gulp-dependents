# gulp-dependents
Gulp plugin that tracks dependencies between files and adds any files that depend
on the files currently in the stream, thus enabling incremental build of `less`,
`scss` and `sass` files, with extensibility points to support other file types.

See `readme.md` in the `gulp-dependents` folder for more info.
